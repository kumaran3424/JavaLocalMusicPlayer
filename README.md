Happy Coding.

A music player alike which will run in command line interface. Then how to use this, there will be a file path mentioned replace with the file you want which music that you listen.

Note: The file should be in this format because java will not understand any fancy formats.

Formats to be used : ( .wav, .au , .aiff)

Then you can convert the mp3 file to a .wav file into seconds using this website - https://www.freeconvert.com/mp3-to-wav
